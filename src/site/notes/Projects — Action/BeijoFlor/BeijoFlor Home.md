# 🕯️Welcome to BeijoFlor

**BeijoFlor is my little corner** — where I share things I’m learning, loving, and figuring out along the way. From deep thoughts to silly joys, mindset shifts to mood boards, this space is all about balance:  
✨ **wondering, enjoying, blooming.**

I’m here to grow and vibe, reflect and romanticise. If that sounds like your kind of energy, you’re exactly where you need to be.
