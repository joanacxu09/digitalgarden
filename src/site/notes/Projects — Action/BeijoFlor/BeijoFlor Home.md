# 🕯️Welcome to BeijoFlor
>Wonder • Enjoy • Bloom

Hi, I'm Joana, and **BeijoFlor is my little digital corner** — where I share things I’m learning, loving, and figuring out along the way. From deep thoughts to silly joys, mindset shifts to mood mindfulness, this space is all about balance. 

Here, we're free to **wonder** curiously, **enjoy** intentionally & **bloom** into our most authentic selves.

I’m here to grow and vibe, reflect and romanticise. If that sounds like your kind of energy, you’ve found the right place. Let’s grow, think, create, and savor — at our own rhythm.
