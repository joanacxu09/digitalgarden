# A reflection on the meaning of life
Is there a meaning to life? If so, is it _the_ meaning, or is meaning simply what each of us decides for ourselves? Is the meaning to find meaning in the freedom we have to define it? Or is it all absurd, and we choose to find meaning regardless—because that is human nature?

The answers—or rather, the arguments—will vary greatly depending on whom you ask: a realist, a romantic, an [[Pillars — Areas/Knowledge/Existentialism\|existentialist]], an [[Pillars — Areas/Knowledge/Absurdism\|absurdist]], a nihilist, a [[Pillars — Areas/Knowledge/Notes/Culture, Religion and History/Christianity\|Christianity]], a [[Pillars — Areas/Knowledge/Notes/People/Carl Jung\|Jungian]], a [[Buddhism\|Buddhist]], or even your next-door neighbour.

Can we reach a consensus? Perhaps by finding patterns or commonalities among these diverse answers. We might map out ways of thinking across different schools of thought, but a true consensus is unlikely.

But let’s digress and begin our reflection with a **blank slate.** Why is meaning important, and why do we seek it?

We might search for answers for the sake of sense-making. Maybe we are inherently curious and cannot help but ask questions. Some might say that finding meaning gives us the strength to continue living in the face of suffering. In this view, life is only worth living if there is meaning.

Yet [[+ Inbox/Albert Camus\|Albert Camus]], the absurdist philosopher, argued that even if we accept that life has no inherent meaning, that does not make it worthless. There is no need to resort to nihilism. Instead, he proposed that we rebel against the universe by defining meaning for ourselves. Even if there is no factual or ultimate meaning, creating one can still sustain us. What if the only meaning is simply to live? Would that be enough to keep us going?

Even if there were _a_ meaning, we could never be absolutely certain of it. How could we distinguish it from speculation? Even if “the answer” were somehow revealed, it would not resemble a scientific discovery like finding the cure for cancer. In our attempt to cure uncertainty, subjectivity would still remain. Perhaps, then, there is no definitive answer—only the meaning that resonates most deeply with each of us.

With that in mind, I’d like to design a meaning for myself. Based on my experiences—the soil from which wisdom grows—I find meaning in the **human experience**:

1. **Love and connection.** With others, with the world. Love contains a powerful meaning in itself.
2. **Happiness.** Different from joy (a fleeting emotion), happiness as a state of being comes from contentment—accepting what is and seeing the good despite circumstances.
3. **Freedom of living.** The freedom to choose our own meaning, define our path—or not define one at all. To be who we wish to be, and to change when we wish. To think freely.
4. **Hope and passion.** The fire that drives us forward, even in uncertainty.

And if we step back, perhaps this all echoes the simple adage: _Live, Laugh, Love._ Maybe clichés endure because they contain a grain of truth.

Meaning, then, is personal. And for that reason, the meaning of life is personal to each individual.
